# ToDo-List
A ToDo list made with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery

This project is part of a Web Development course I took. This part focuses specifically on CSS and jQuery.

The goal was to create a todo list where the user can add and remove "Todo's", and even scratch those that have been completed (without removing them from the list).

It features jQuery for selecting elements and programming the logic, and a lot of CSS for the styling.
